                            Originally an educator, I found software engineering by chance. A friend of mine, another software engineer, gave me a curriculum to try because he thought I’d enjoy learning the trade. He was right, within days of starting my learning journey I was hooked.

                            I currently use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack for my projects, but I am open to learning new languages and databases. I have also started using TypeScript in my newer websites. I also have experience creating and using Rest APIs. I use responsive design in all my projects, the websites I create look great on computers, mobile devices, and tablets.

                            I design, create, and maintain websites for myself and clients.
