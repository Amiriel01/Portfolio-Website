        description: "This website has a responsive design that looks great on computers, tablets, and phones. It integrates the RESTful API backend I built and the Google Books API for a great user experience. The site also links to external resource websites in the student resources section. As an avid reader and library patron in my own town, I thought this would be a fun and interesting site to build. The website has many instances where users can create, read, update, and delete information. To demo all the features you will need the library login credintials. Logging in to the library site will grant admin permissions that an employee would be given to view forms and to update records and events.The login is located in the footer of the site.",
